    desc: "It all started when I discovered a platform called Codecademy. On this platform it allowed you to get the feel for coding and programming while working in an interactive repl. I was instantly hooked by the idea of building beautiful, engaging apps and solving complex problems along the way. Since my discovery of coding 2 years ago I've since built many projects, collaborated with many wonderful developers and recently completed a 12 week intensive program on Full Stack Engineering. I'm always looking to learn more and open to any conversation about opportunities, insights or just a coffee chat!",
